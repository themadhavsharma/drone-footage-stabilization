# 🎥 Drone Footage Stabilizer - OpenCV GUI Tool

This is a Python-based GUI application that stabilizes shaky drone footage using optical flow and affine transformations. It provides a simple interface to process and smooth out video shake, without needing any prior video editing skills or command-line use.

## 📽️ Features

- 🎞️ Stabilizes drone or handheld video footage
- 🖱️ Easy-to-use GUI built with **Tkinter**
- 🔍 Uses **OpenCV** for optical flow-based motion estimation
- 🔧 Frame-to-frame motion smoothing using Gaussian blur
- 📊 Real-time progress bar during processing
- 💾 Automatically saves the stabilized video in the same folder as the input

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Tkinter (built-in Python GUI library)
